      Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient history. In
      the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during
      the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top
      of their battle shields[25][26] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their
      bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.[27][28] An early reference to a
      pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies,
      foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by
      hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are
      served a meal that includes round cakes (such as pita bread) topped with
      cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are
      the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno. [29] In 2023, archeologists discovered
      a fresco in Pompeii appearing to depict a pizza-like dish among other
      foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said
      it "may be a distant ancestor of the modern dish". [30][31] The first
      mention of the word pizza comes from a notarial document written in Latin
      and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve
      pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas
      and a couple of chickens on Easter Day".[32]
